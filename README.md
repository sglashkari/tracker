# Animal Marker Tracker

The Animal Marker Tracker is a software system designed to track animals by identifying and analyzing markers placed on their bodies. This README provides an overview of the Marker Tracker, including its features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Features

The Animal Marker Tracker offers the following key features:

1. **Marker Detection**: The system detects markers placed on animals using computer vision techniques.
2. **Real-Time Tracking**: The system tracks the markers in real-time, allowing for live monitoring of animal movements.
3. **Post-Processing**: The software includes post-processing algorithms to refine the tracking results and improve accuracy.
4. **Multiple Animal Tracking**: The system supports tracking multiple animals simultaneously.
5. **Matlab and C++ Implementation**: The Marker Tracker is implemented using both Matlab and C++, providing flexibility and performance.

## Prerequisites

To use the Animal Marker Tracker, you need to have the following software and libraries installed:

1. Matlab: Version R2019a or later.
2. C++ Compiler: An up-to-date C++ compiler compatible with your operating system.
3. OpenCV: A computer vision library. Version 3.0 or later is recommended.
4. Matlab Image Processing Toolbox: This toolbox is required for some of the marker detection and post-processing algorithms.
